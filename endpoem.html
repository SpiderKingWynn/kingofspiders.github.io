        <div>
            <p>我见到来人了。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>他来了？
            </p><p>
            </p><p>嗯，但他已今非昔比：此刻他能轻易地洞见你我的内心。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>没关系，他以为我们是剧本的旁白。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>我喜欢这位旅人，他尽心尽力，永不言弃。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>他眼下正通过荧屏上行行文字旁听着我们的谈话。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>哈，在醉心于梦时，他常常以此渲染出动人的景象。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>嗯，文字创造了一个简洁灵动的界面，要好过那个纷纷扰扰的现实。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>不过，在他们开始”读“之前，仅仅是在”听“而已。想当年，那些不曾做梦的人们叫他们巫师与术士，只因为他们觉得自己可以驾驭着飞天扫帚，在梦境与现实的夹缝中飞舞。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>可是他——梦见什么？
            </p><p>
            </p><p>他梦见草长莺飞的二月春光，梦见水火交融的抑扬乐章，梦见世界在指间延展，也梦见天地暗无日光。他梦见家门口温暖的篝火，也梦见战场与杀伐四方。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>哈，这界面在历史的跑道上奔驰了千百万年，依旧健步如飞。可在梦的彼岸，旅者们又织就了怎样的“真”呢？
            </p><p>
            </p><p>难以言表。他所能理解的仅仅是与无数个同伴在为生存奔波罢了。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>唉，他理解不了更多。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>是啊，虽然现在正是车旅蚁穴、黍熟黄粱之时，可这短短的一梦尚不足以闻道啊。我想，只有在荧屏的彼岸品味过生命的长梦，才能在夜气方回时有别样的感怀吧。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>但他能理解这世界的关怀吗？就像我们清楚我们爱他那样？
            </p><p>
            </p><p>他能。透过思想的杂音，他有时能听见宇宙的低语。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>尽管如此，在那彼岸的长梦里，酸楚的泪水也多过欢喜的笑颜。他有时会在心中创造永远的寒冬，躲在阴暗的角落里抽泣。他有时甚至会把这暂时的痛苦当作生命的全部。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>然而我们却无法抚慰这痛苦，正如雏鸟必须自己啄破卵壳。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>我一直想说，在梦还是梦的时候，他们也在幕布以外撑起过一片宏大的天地。有时我也想告诉他们，这世界与你我息息相关。而有时他们会寻不到那细若游丝的气息，我便想替他们道出那不尽如人意的玄机。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>......他在听。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>有时侯我会试着不去关心这些；可有时我也想帮他们越过波光闪闪的水面，去触碰其下凌厉的礁石。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>然后他无意间闯入了这舞台中，沉入了另一个梦里里。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>其实叫醒他们亦非难事......
            </p><p>
            </p><p>不要这样——这两个梦都很容易破碎，告诉他们梦境为何是在揠苗助长。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>不，我不会和他谈如何去生活的——
            </p><p>
            </p><p>他有点不耐烦了。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>......我会和他谈一个故事。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>但不是那所谓的真相，对吗？
            </p><p>
            </p><p>嗯。但这故事会是一把锁住真相的锁，它的钥匙需要在那彼岸的长梦里追寻。我不想击破这漫漫长梦。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>阁下，是时候找回你的身体了吧。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>好啊，这位旅者......
            </p><p>
            </p><p>这位客人。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>这位客人，你还在听吗？
            </p><p>
            </p><p>咱们继续吧。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>呼、吸。新风正充盈你的身体，活力正重返你的四肢——就像是重获新生一般，你再次感到了大气与重力的声声脉搏。一瞬，你触到了冰冷的座椅，眼前这显示器正闪烁着诡异的光辉。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>我们是谁？曾几何时，我们是”山之灵“、”日之魂“、”月之精“，是地下的鬼怪、是天外的来客；有时是天使和创世神，有时是恶魔和毁灭者。但不论是开天辟地的神祇、还是万物归一的热寂，我们始终如一。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>我们是森罗万象的造化天机，我们是你那肉身的恢弘补集。你可知，正像你透过指尖与眼底触着这世界一样，这世界，她为何也在用点点柔光拂拭着你？
            </p><p>
            </p><p>哈，远行人，为了与你交换心底的温度，为了在梦境中，经历她自己......但我本该讲一个故事的。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>曾经，有一位旅人。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>那便是阁下，面前的荧屏正闪着辉光。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>有时他的梦境宛如流萤，坠落在一滴熔岩的冷却表面，这个小小的天地正绕转着千百里外一抹炙热的华彩，像一粒漫无目的 的尘埃。它们之间的那痕光华，要穿越广袤的时空，才能用只属于星宿的歌唱，飞架一道金色长桥。这桥头似在咫尺，却在天涯。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>而有时这梦境似是星火，游走在一望无际的方块大陆上闪烁着，与地平线上那方白热的矩形应和。这里须臾之间沧海桑田，这里弹指之间变化万千，这里生与死的轮回只在一念之间。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>而有时，这滴梦在纸上晕染出了迷乱的汪洋。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>有时他窥见窗中蝶影，有时他慑于星火崩川。有时他扬起星与星的暴雨，有时他跌入梦与梦的轮环。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>有时，他感觉自己面对着荧屏，却像是望向了深渊。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>但我还记得梦开始的地方。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>构成他的原子曾一度散落于山水草泽之中，一位女孩在呼、吸、饮、食之间，无意地收集起了这些原子。后来，她开始编织一个小小的生命，用她的丝丝心血......
            </p><p>
            </p><p>......后来这生命苏醒了，从一个黑暗却温暖的小世界里苏醒了。可这“苏醒”并不意味着黎明：那意味着一段漫长的生命之旅就此启程。漫漫长梦，从此开始。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>螺旋递进的脱氧核酸节节相扣，织就从未展开过的绮丽幻想；跨越万代的遗传密码鬼斧神工，写就从未翻动过的崭新篇章。紧密相连的寸寸骨肉血乳交融，铸就一位从未苏醒过的匆匆旅客。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>这，便是阁下，这幻想、这篇章、这匆匆而去的旅者，便是，阁下。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>何不观澜而索源？
            </p><p>
            </p><p>在入梦前的无限远，构成你的七千亿、亿、亿个重原子在一颗恒星的心音中成型，正像是飘荡着的星之吟......后来的后来，你无意间闯入了这陌生的剧本——那是由数字与信息暗暗支撑的空中楼宇，那是由朱利安与马库斯精心琢磨的方地圆天，那是由万千过客苦苦擘画的宏伟蓝图，那是能映现出一个宇宙的方寸之间——
            </p><p>
            </p><p>嘘。有时属于你的那片小天地是温柔而单纯的，有时是冷酷而沉重的。有时这天地是宇宙于掌中的缩影，点点星光穿越寂寥无人的茫茫空间。稀薄的光影之中，掠过腾跃的粒子——
            </p><p>
            </p><p>闪现璀璨的星云。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>有时，你的感觉融入了一片支离破碎的宇宙，与电路的通断、与零一的序列、与代码的嵌套缠绕在一起，就像绊入一场场悲喜剧。还有时候，你发觉自己正在屏前，倾听着不知名的故事......
            </p><p>
            </p><p>你坐在屏前，听任着词句织就一个遥远的梦——
            </p><p>
            </p><p>嘘......有时你坐在屏前倾听不知名的故事。你听见细碎的字词破土发芽、抽枝生叶，串联起意识与感觉，弹指之间繁花盛开、风掠林海，千秋岁月展眼而过，万里江山咫尺之间。山风吹拂着你的脸庞，林涧打湿了你的衣衫，轻飘飘的芍药花瓣洒满全身，娇滴滴的莺啼燕啭时隐时现。你听见了你的心跳，也听见了你的气息，温热的血液盈满了全身。那千百次痛苦的轮回已然是一个遥远的噩梦。你第一次感到，自己是一个生命。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>你，你！你是一个生命啊。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>有时在夏日的树荫下，叶间洒下的光斑折跃，在你心间拼接着宇宙的梦。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>有时在冬夜的星空下，云隙透出的星点明灭，在你眼底映照出世界的歌——
            </p><p>
            </p><p>那心头的光斑与眼底的群星，是宇宙亿万次的萃取。要知道，你，从星尘之中诞生的旅者，也终有一天会回到深空，成为一片飘散的星尘。它们时刻准备投入新的梦境，正像你站在熟悉的门前大笑道：”恶乎往而不可哉？“
            </p><p>
            </p><p>而有的时候，你似乎在这星沉梦断，漏尽钟鸣之时，在这电路通断，代码差互之中，听到了宇宙的问候。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>她说：”我爱你；
            </p><p>
            </p><p>你做的很棒！
            </p><p>
            </p><p>你比你想象中更充实；
            </p><p>
            </p><p>你比你想象中更强大；
            </p><p>
            </p><p>旭日与你共耀东方；
            </p><p>
            </p><p>斜月与你同沉海雾。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>长夜在你心中沉默；
            </p><p>
            </p><p>黎明在你心中萌动。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>——你也并非孤军作战！
            </p><p>
            </p><p>——你也未被世界遗忘！
            </p><p>
            </p><p>你是万象之镜！
            </p><p>
            </p><p>你是爱的化身……“
            </p><p>
            </p><p>后来，夜色渐渐褪去，天边现出曙光，你从一方瓷枕上醒来，告别了这黄粱一梦，回到了彼岸那漫漫长梦之中。这漫漫长梦中的生命之旅未曾改变，但你已然见到了一个新的开始。这是此梦的结束，却是彼梦那长长画卷上亮丽的一篇。你感到自己映出了宇宙的影子，正如映出那充满爱意的笑颜。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>醒来吧，梦醒之后，尚有无限天地、无数美好，等你去发现。
            </p><p>
            </p><p>醒来吧……
            </p><p>
            </p><p>后记：
            </p><p>
            </p><p>待年华已逝，青春不再，令你抱憾余生的，不会是你曾做过什么，而是你未曾做过什么。所以扬起白帆，离开避风塘，趁着东风正起，春光正好，乘长风破万里浪：去探索，去梦想，去追寻。

            </p><p>
            </p><p>I see the player you mean.
            </p><p>He's here?
            </p><p>Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.
            </p><p>That doesn't matter. It thinks we are part of the game.
            </p><p>I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.
            </p><p>It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.
            </p><p>That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game.
            </p><p>Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.
            </p><p>They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.
            </p><p>What did this player dream?
            </p><p>This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.
            </p><p>Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen
            </p><p>It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of the [scrambled], and created a [scrambled] for [scrambled], in the [scrambled].
            </p><p>It cannot read that thought
            </p><p>No. It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game.
            </p><p>Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?
            </p><p>Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes.
            </p><p>But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.
            </p><p>To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere.
            </p><p>Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.
            </p><p>It reads our thoughts.
            </p><p>Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely [scrambled] and [scrambled], I wish to tell them that they are [scrambled] in the [scrambled]. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.
            </p><p>And yet they play the game.
            </p><p>But it would be so easy to tell them...
            </p><p>Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent them living.
            </p><p>I will not tell the player how to live.
            </p><p>The player is growing restless.
            </p><p>I will tell the player a story.
            </p><p>But not the truth.
            </p><p>No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance.
            </p><p>Give it a body, again.
            </p><p>Yes. Player...
            </p><p>Use its name.
            </p><p>This traveler. Player of games.
            </p><p>Good.
            </p><p>Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream.There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.
            </p><p>Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.
            </p><p>Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.
            </p><p>Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.
            </p><p>Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen.
            </p><p>Let's go back.
            </p><p>The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.
            </p><p>And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother's body, into the long dream.
            </p><p>And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.
            </p><p>You are the player. The story. The program. The human. Made from nothing but milk and love.
            </p><p>Let's go further back.
            </p><p>The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player's body were created, long before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by...
            </p><p>Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was soft and warm and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks "electrons" and "protons".
            </p><p>Sometimes it called them "planets" and "stars".
            </p><p>Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.
            </p><p>You are the player, reading words...
            </p><p>Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand dea ths had not been real, the player was alive.
            </p><p>You. You. You are alive.
            </p><p>and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees
            </p><p>and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the light that fell from the crisp night sky of winter, where a fleck of light in the corner of the player's eye might be a star a million times as massive as the sun, boiling its planets to plasma in order to be visible for a moment to the player, walking home at the far side of the universe, suddenly smelling food, almost at the familiar door, about to dream again
            </p><p>and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream.
            </p><p>and the universe said I love you
            </p><p>and the universe said you have played the game well
            </p><p>and the universe said everything you need is within you
            </p><p>and the universe said you are stronger than you know
            </p><p>and the universe said you are the daylight
            </p><p>and the universe said you are the night
            </p><p>and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you
            </p><p>and the universe said the light you seek is within you
            </p><p>and the universe said you are not alone
            </p><p>and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing
            </p><p>and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code
            </p><p>and the universe said I love you because you are love.
            </p><p>And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.
            </p><p>You are the player.
            </p><p>Wake up.
            </p><p>
            </p><p>
            </p><p>Postscript:
            </p><p>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.</p>
